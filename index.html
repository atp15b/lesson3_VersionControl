            </h2>
            <p class="lead">A Version Control System is a system that allows users to keep track of changes that have been made to a file or multiple files over a period of time. It allows you to keep every version of a file so that you can revert files back to a previous state if desired. It also allows you to look at the changes that have been made to a file over a period of time. This topic interests me because I believe it to be extremely useful when it comes to troubleshooting projects. This topic is relevant to this course because this system can be used by application developers when they are creating new projects.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">The simplest way of using a Version Control System is to copy the files in question into another directory on the userâ€™s local computer. However, while this method is quite simple, it is also easy to make mistakes when using this method. It is easy to copy files that you do not mean to or to forget which directory you are in when using this method. Programmers have developed local Version Control Systems that include a simple database that keep changes made to files under revision control in order to combat these mistakes. This topic interests me because it explains an easy method of using a Version Control System. This topic is relevant to this course because it shows that you can compare changes that have been made to a file on your local computer.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Centralized Version Control Systems are used so that different developers can work together on the same project. These systems work by uploading all of the associated files to a single server that is shared by multiple people. This is the most popular Version Control System. A disadvantage of this system is that if the server fails, it can affect multiple people that are working on the same project. This topic interests me because it shows how I can collaborate with other people on a project. This topic is relevant to this course because it shows how application developers can work together.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Distributed Version Control Systems</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Distributed Version Control Systems are a type of Centralized Version Control System that allow users to view the full history of a file repository on their own computers rather than just on the server. This way if a server is no longer functioning, all of the computers that had a connection to that server have individual backups of the information that was stored on that server. As a result of this, a non-functioning server can be restored by backing up one of the computers with the stored information to the server. This topic interests me because it solves the problem of the Centralized Version Control System. This topic is relevant to this course because it explains how the best version of a Version Control System works so that it can be used by web application developers.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git is one of the Distributed Version Control Systems that have been created. Git is different than other Version Control Systems in that it thinks about each version of a certain file as a snapshot of that file. Every time a change is made to a certain file and saved, Git takes a picture of what the file looks like at that time and stores a reference to that picture as that version of the file in question. This topic interests me because it is quite different than other Version Control Systems that I have read about. This topic is relevant to this course because we are using Git in this course as our Version Control System.</p>
